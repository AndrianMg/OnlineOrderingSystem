## Advanced Programming Approaches

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

#### 3.1.1 Encapsulation

The application demonstrates proper encapsulation through private fields and public properties:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int CustomerID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    private List<Order> _orderHistory = new List<Order>();
    
    public void PlaceOrder(Cart cart)
    {
        // Encapsulated business logic
        var order = new Order();
        order.CreateOrder(CustomerID, cart);
        _orderHistory.Add(order);
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.2 Inheritance

The payment system demonstrates inheritance through an abstract base class:

```csharp
public abstract class Payment
{
    protected double Amount { get; set; }
    public abstract void ProcessPayment();
    public abstract bool ValidatePayment();
}

public class Cash : Payment
{
    public override void ProcessPayment() 
    { 
        // Cash-specific processing logic
    }
    
    public override bool ValidatePayment() 
    { 
        // Cash validation logic
        return Amount > 0;
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Polymorphism

The system uses polymorphism extensively in payment processing:

```csharp
public bool ProcessPayment(Payment payment)
{
    // Polymorphic behavior - works with any payment type
    payment.ProcessPayment();
    return payment.GetPaymentStatus() == "Completed";
}
```

#### 3.1.4 Abstraction

Abstract classes and interfaces provide clear contracts:

```csharp
public interface IOrderingService
{
    List<Item> GetAllItems();
    List<Item> GetItemsByCategory(string category);
    Order PlaceOrder(int customerID, List<int> itemIDs);
    bool ProcessPayment(Payment payment);
}
```

### 3.2 Design Patterns

#### 3.2.1 Singleton Pattern

The `GlobalClass` implements a thread-safe singleton for global application state:

```csharp
public class GlobalClass
{
    private static GlobalClass? _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    public static GlobalClass GetInstance()
    {
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = new GlobalClass();
                }
            }
        }
        return _instance;
    }
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Strategy Pattern

Payment processing uses the Strategy pattern for different payment methods:

```csharp
// Different payment strategies
var cashPayment = new Cash(100.0);
var creditPayment = new Credit(100.0, "1234-5678-9012-3456");
var checkPayment = new Check(100.0, "123456");

// Same processing interface
service.ProcessPayment(cashPayment);
service.ProcessPayment(creditPayment);
service.ProcessPayment(checkPayment);
```

#### 3.2.3 Observer Pattern

Order status notifications use the Observer pattern:

```csharp
public interface IOrderObserver
{
    void Update(Order order);
}

public class OrderSubject : IOrderSubject
{
    private readonly List<IOrderObserver> _observers = new List<IOrderObserver>();
    
    public void UpdateOrderStatus(string newStatus)
    {
        _order.OrderStatus = newStatus;
        Notify(); // Notify all observers
    }
}
```

#### 3.2.4 Dependency Injection

Service layer uses constructor injection for loose coupling:

```csharp
public class OrderingService : IOrderingService
{
    private readonly OrderingDbContext _context;
    
    public OrderingService(OrderingDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Delegates and Lambda Expressions

#### 3.3.1 Custom Delegates

The application implements custom delegates for event handling:

```csharp
public delegate void OrderEventHandler(Order order, string eventType);
public delegate void PaymentEventHandler(Payment payment, bool success);
```

#### 3.3.2 Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions are used extensively for LINQ queries and event handling:

```csharp
// LINQ with lambda expressions
var availableItems = items.Where(item => item.Available).ToList();
var highValueOrders = orders.Where(order => order.TotalAmount > 50.0)
                           .OrderByDescending(order => order.TotalAmount)
                           .ToList();

// Event handlers with lambda expressions
OrderCreated += (order, eventType) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Order {order.OrderID} {eventType} at {DateTime.Now}");
};
```

#### 3.3.3 Functional Programming

The application demonstrates functional programming concepts:

```csharp
public (int totalOrders, double totalRevenue, double averageOrderValue) 
    GetOrderStatistics(List<Order> orders)
{
    var totalOrders = orders.Count;
    var totalRevenue = orders.Sum(order => order.TotalAmount);
    var averageOrderValue = orders.Any() ? 
        orders.Average(order => order.TotalAmount) : 0;

    return (totalOrders, totalRevenue, averageOrderValue);
}
```

### 3.4 Exception Handling

#### 3.4.1 Custom Exceptions

The application implements domain-specific custom exceptions:

```csharp
public class InvalidOrderException : Exception
{
    public int OrderId { get; }
    public string OrderStatus { get; }

    public InvalidOrderException(string message, int orderId, string orderStatus) 
        : base(message)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
        OrderStatus = orderStatus;
    }
}
```

#### 3.4.2 Comprehensive Exception Handling

All critical operations include proper exception handling:

```csharp
public List<Item> GetAllItems()
{
    try
    {
        _globalClass.LogEvent("Service", "Retrieved all items");
        return _context.GetAllItems().Where(item => item.Available).ToList();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _globalClass.LogEvent("Error", $"Failed to retrieve items: {ex.Message}");
        throw;
    }
}
```

### 3.5 LINQ and Data Processing

The application extensively uses LINQ for data manipulation:

```csharp
// Complex LINQ queries with lambda expressions
var groupedItems = cartItems.GroupBy(cartItem => cartItem.Item.Name)
                           .Select(g => new { 
                               Name = g.Key, 
                               Count = g.Sum(ci => ci.Quantity), 
                               Price = g.First().Item.Price 
                           })
                           .ToList();
```

## Development Evolution and Refactoring

### 4.1 Initial Implementation Phase

The development began with a basic class structure based on the UML diagram, implementing core entities such as `Customer`, `Order`, `Item`, and `Cart`. The initial implementation focused on establishing the fundamental OOP principles and basic functionality.

### 4.2 Database Integration Evolution

**Problem**: Initial implementation used in-memory data storage.

**Solution**: Successfully migrated to Entity Framework Core with SQL Server, implementing proper migrations and data seeding.

**Improvements**:
- Real database persistence with SQL Server
- Proper migration management
- Data seeding for testing and demonstration
- Connection string configuration

### 4.3 Refactoring for Design Patterns

**Problem**: The initial payment processing was tightly coupled and difficult to extend.

**Solution**: Implemented the Strategy pattern for payment processing, allowing different payment methods to have their own validation and processing logic while maintaining a consistent interface.

**Before**:
```csharp
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public bool ProcessCashPayment(double amount) { /* Cash logic */ }
    public bool ProcessCreditPayment(double amount, string cardNumber) { /* Credit logic */ }
    public bool ProcessCheckPayment(double amount, string checkNumber) { /* Check logic */ }
}
```

**After**:
```csharp
public abstract class Payment
{
    public abstract void ProcessPayment();
    public abstract bool ValidatePayment();
}

public class Cash : Payment { /* Cash implementation */ }
public class Credit : Payment { /* Credit implementation */ }
public class Check : Payment { /* Check implementation */ }
```

### 4.4 UI Enhancement Refactoring

**Problem**: The original UI was basic and lacked modern design principles.

**Solution**: Implemented a modern, card-based design with gradient backgrounds, proper event handling, and responsive layouts.

**Key Improvements**:
- Gradient background implementation using `LinearGradientBrush`
- Card-style panels with shadow effects
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Proper event handling with lambda expressions

### 4.5 Exception Handling Refactoring

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive exception handling with custom exceptions and proper logging.

**Improvements**:
- Custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- Proper exception propagation and logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for non-critical errors

### 4.6 Service Layer Architecture

**Problem**: Business logic was scattered throughout the UI layer.

**Solution**: Designed and implemented a service layer with proper dependency injection patterns.

**Current Status**: Service layer is implemented but not yet integrated into the main application.

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection ready
- Testable business logic
- Future integration path established
